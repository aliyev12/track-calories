# track-calories
This is an app for tracking calories. Users can enter food items and calories, and the app will calculate and display the total calories. 
App data is persisted into a browser local storage, so this app doesn't use any external API. Also, this app is a pure vanilla ES5 JavaScript app that doesn't use any external JavaScript packages/build tools (Webpack, Babel etc). It is built using a Model View Controller (MVC) pattern, and the User Interface (UI) is styled with Materialize CSS.
